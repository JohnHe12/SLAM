# C++ Concurrency

## Thread Management

### the basic operation of threads

- need `#include<thread>`
- use `std::thread` to create a object of the thread
- in the `CmakeLists.txt` need a line `find_package(Threads)` and the excutable target need link the library `target_link_libraries(.. PUBLIC Threads::Threads)`

for example to start some threads

```cpp
#include<thread>
void do_some_work();
std::thread t(do_some_work); // here is a function
```

even we can use a class construct the instances which contain function operator types

```cpp
#include<thread>
class background_task
{
publicï¼š
    void operator()() const
    {
        do_somthing();
        do_something_else();
    }

};

background_task f;
std::thread t(f);

// Note: if the function use quote & may cause the error the detail see the code
```

or use lambda expression

```cpp
std::thread t([]{
    do_something();
    do_something_else();
})
```

### wait for the thread to finish

use `join()` and `detach()` if use `detach()` to divide the thread, after start the thread,we can directly use `detach()` to divide the thread, but it need to carefully select a position for `join()` in order to avoid application termination by throw exceptions. so if we want to finish the thread before the object is detected, we can create a class to guarantee the thread will finish first.

```cpp
#include<thread>
#include"func.h"

class thread_guard
{
    public:
    explicit thread_guard(std::thread& t_):t(t_) {};
    thread_guard(const thread_guard&)=delete;
    thread_guard operator=(const thread_guard&)=delete;
    ~thread_guard()
    {
        if(t.joinable())
        {
            t.join();
            std::cout << "stop the thread" << std::endl;
        }
    }

    std::thread& t;
};

int main()
{
    int a =3;
    func f(a);

    std::thread t(f);
    thread_guard g(t);
    std::cout << "start thread" << std::endl;
}
```

### Transform the ownership

use the`std::move(t)` to transform the ownership or use the temp var

### confirm the number of the threads

use `std::thread::hardware::concurrency()`
